In this project, I developed software for a wireless vacuum cleaner equipped with multiple perception sensors. 
These sensors enable the device to map its surroundings and make decisions based on both the generated map and its internal state. 
The system integrates cameras, LiDAR, GPS, and IMU sensors, all operating concurrently. 
The software manages parallel data collection and computation, maintaining synchronization through a global clock. Certain computations involve the real-time fusion of data from multiple sensors.
